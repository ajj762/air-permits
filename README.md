# Missouri air permits


 This is the beginning of an [exploratory analysis](https://github.com/ajj762/air-permits/blob/main/scripts/july1-completed-air-permits.Rmd) I started for my internship at Kansas City PBS over the summer of 2022. 
 
 I received two data files from a FOIA request of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources on air permits in the entire state as of July 1, 2022:
 - [Completed permits](https://github.com/ajj762/air-permits/blob/main/data/2022-07-01CompletedProjects.txt)
 - [Pending permits](https://github.com/ajj762/air-permits/blob/main/data/2022-07-01PendingProjects.txt)
